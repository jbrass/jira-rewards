Does humor belong in JIRA?

So bosses, instead of offering you a bonus beer, they offer you some self-esteem little polished image on
your profile? Man, I tell you: they are fooling you ...

That's the real reason to hate gamification. Nowadays, seems that everybody is offering for your help (karma)
points, badges, status levels (who wants to be a king?). So how about the real things? Like beer: this is
eternal ... well, until you drink it.

Your colleagues who are asking for your help are also to blame for this beerless world. With this plugin,
we wanted to address another well known behavior of helped people: they tend to forget. How many times have
you heard: "Thanks, man, I owe you a beer". Really? Let's put a note somewhere ...

And we, the beer drinkers, we, the know-it-all, are agile too! So we mocked the SCRUM terminology. You have
to create a beer sprint, put beer rewards into it, and when you finally receive some help from us, grant it to
the one that helps you.

When the sprint ends, just create and print the beer sprint report, and take it with you to your favourite
bar. We placed a border on the table so you can follow the rows and columns with your finger no matter the state you're in,
and we even predicted the outcome (very complicated algorithm, the most tricky part was to guess your mass from the
metrics in your projects, like the number of re-opens).

That concludes the marketing text for this plugin.

Consumer warning: you must be at least 18 to install this plugin. Actual number depends on the country. Check local laws.

Serious note: this plugin is not intended to win Codegeist 2013 - although, let's be honest, it would buy a lot of beer -
but to celebrate the longest Codegeist in history! Cheers!
